									<p>I have recently earned a Masters in Economics from the University of California, Irvine. 
								    	My primary research is in the field of public economics. In particular, 
									I research how social influence affects contributions to public goods. My <a href="http://gradworks.umi.com/15/98/1598090.html" target="_blank">
									Master's Thesis</a> examines the effect of contributions to charity made by an 
									individual's reference group on the amount the individual contributes. 
									My career began with a Bachelors and Masters in Economics from the 
									University of North Carolina at Charlotte. During this time, I assisted 
									Dr. Ellen Sewell in her research on fixed book price laws in Europe and
									the welfare implications of resale price maintenance. I also aided
									Dr. Paul Gaggl in his research on the distributional effect on wages 
									from electricity adoption in the early 20th century. Furthermore,
									I completed two professional internships; in the first internship I helped
									implement an enterprise software system for Kimbrell's Furniture, Inc.,
									in the second internship I found cost saving vendor alternatives in the 
									purchasing department of the University of North Carolina, Charlotte.
									Now, I hope to continue my career in the pursuit of further knowledge
									and professional development.</p>
